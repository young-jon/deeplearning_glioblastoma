# deeplearning_glioblastoma

Code used for my paper:  _Unsupervised deep learning reveals prognostically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma_ 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984190

Code forked from Deep Learning Tutorials:  https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials 

Main model used in paper was a deep belief network (DBN) or, as I call it, 
a stacked restricted boltzmann machines - deep autoencoder (SRBM-DA)
