# deeplearning_glioblastoma

Deep learning code used for my paper:  _Unsupervised deep learning reveals prognostically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma_ 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984190 

Clustering code used for the paper may be added at a later date.

Code forked from Deep Learning Tutorials:  https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials 

Main model used in paper was a deep belief network (DBN) or, as I call it, 
a stacked restricted boltzmann machines - deep autoencoder (SRBM-DA). The code in this repo uses Theano ("Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently." http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/ )

Files that have been changed from original fork have 'jdy' in the filename.

## requirements
python 2.7

theano

numpy

matplotlib
